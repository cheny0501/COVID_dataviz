# BMI-706 Final Project

-By Tony Ding (xiayiding@hsph.harvard.edu) and Chen Yang (cyang1@hsph.harvard.edu)

## Datasets used:
The links to the two data files that are needed to run this app are located in the "Links to datasets" file located in this respository. The first dataset is produced by the New York Times, and it focuses on COVID-19 cases and deaths within each county/state of the US in 2021 (i.e. it records cases and deaths of COVID-19 each day by county). The second dataset is compiled by Our World in Data, and it contains information on the various vaccination data of each state throughout the years. 

## What can you expect to learn from this project?

1. The Trend of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US over the Year of 2021 (area charts).
2. Temporal Evolution of COVID-19 Vaccination Counts and Case Fatality Rates in the US throughout 2021 (line and bar charts) .
3. Geographical Distribution of COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Vaccinations Administered per Hundred People in the US throughout 2021  (maps).
4. More observation analysis and insights about future work.
